# 2D WEBGL FLIP Fluid Simulation
This project is a fluid simulation using the FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle) method. The simulation is rendered using WebGL and provides an interactive interface for users to manipulate the fluid and observe its behavior.
## Features
- Real-time color classification
- Interactive RGB sliders
- Adaptive text color based on background brightness
- Neural network training visualization
- Responsive color feedback
## Demo
- Interactive interface with Fluid controls
- Clickable & Draggable Obstacle
## Usage
1. Particles: Toggle the visibility of the particles.
2. Grid: Toggle the visibility of the grid.
3. Compensate Drift: Toggle the compensation of particle drift.
4. Separate Particles: Toggle the separation of particles.
5. PIC to FLIP Ratio: Adjust the ratio between PIC (Particle-In-Cell) and FLIP (Fluid-Implicit Particle) methods
6. Click and Drag the "Obstacle" to interact with the fluid
## Technologies Used
- Vite + Vanilla JS
- WEBGL
